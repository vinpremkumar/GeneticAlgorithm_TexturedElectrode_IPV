# GeneticAlgorithm_TexturedElectrode_IPV
Using evolutionary algorithm to model surface texture of electrodes in indoor photovoltaics (IPVs). It creates a complimentary grating pattern on the top and bottom electrodes. The transport layer is designed as a buffer around the electrodes and the interspace is filled by the active layer such that the active layer thickness at any position is the same regardless of the grating pattern. The source code has the ability to be edited to produce single electrode grating pattern or even mirror the grating pattern on both the electrodes (active layer thickness will vary in this case with position).
